*zshdb* is gdb-like debugger for [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) scripts. It started as a port of my bash
debugger [bashdb](http://bashdb.sf.net) so the commands used in both are similar.

The command syntax generally follows that of the trepanning debuggers
and, more generally, GNU debugger *gdb*. Therefore knowledge gained by learning this is transferable to those
debuggers and vice versa.

An Emacs interface is available via [realgud](https://github.com/realgud/realgud). Visual Studio integration is available from rogalmic via
[ZshDebug](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rogalmic.zsh-debug).


See the [documentation](http://zshdb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [wiki](https://github.com/rocky/zshdb/wiki)
for more information.
