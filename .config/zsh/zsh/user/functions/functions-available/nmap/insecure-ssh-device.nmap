| [CVE-2013-0175] multi_xml gem 0.5.2 for Ruby, as used in Grape before 0.2.6 and possibly other products, does not properly restrict casts of string values, which allows remote attackers to conduct object-injection attacks and execute arbitrary code, or cause a denial of service (memory and CPU consumption) involving nested XML entity references, by leveraging support for (1) YAML type conversion or (2) Symbol type conversion, a similar vulnerability to CVE-2013-0156.
| [CVE-2013-0156] active_support/core_ext/hash/conversions.rb in Ruby on Rails before 2.3.15, 3.0.x before 3.0.19, 3.1.x before 3.1.10, and 3.2.x before 3.2.11 does not properly restrict casts of string values, which allows remote attackers to conduct object-injection attacks and execute arbitrary code, or cause a denial of service (memory and CPU consumption) involving nested XML entity references, by leveraging Action Pack support for (1) YAML type conversion or (2) Symbol type conversion.
| [CVE-2013-0005] The WCF Replace function in the Open Data (aka OData) protocol implementation in Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5, 3.5 SP1, 3.5.1, and 4, and the Management OData IIS Extension on Windows Server 2012, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption and daemon restart) via crafted values in HTTP requests, aka "Replace Denial of Service Vulnerability."
