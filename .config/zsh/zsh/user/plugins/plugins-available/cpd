# Author W.Friebel friebel@ifh.de 13/04/95
#
# Usage: cpd
#        displays the directories in the buffer stack
#	 chose the directory you want to cd to with the cursor keys
#	 optionally edit the directory string
#	 select the directory by pressing Enter (or ^X^W)
#	 or leave the menu with ^C
#
# The function is of little use unless the option autopushd is set.
# It is furthermore useful to set pushdsilent and pushdignoredups
# the dirs or pushd function can be used in addition to preload frequently
# used directories into the directory stack
