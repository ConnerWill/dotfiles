= Zsh Shift Select Mode
:proj-name: zsh-shift-select
:gh-name: jirutka/{proj-name}
// Enable kbd:[] macro
:experimental:

Emacs https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Shift-Selection.html[shift-select mode] for Zsh – select text in the command line using kbd:[Shift] as in many text editors, browsers and other GUI programs.

This plugin does not override any existing widgets and binds only **shift**ed keys (see <<Key Bindings>>).
It creates a new `shift-select` keymap that is automatically activated when the shift selection is invoked (using any of the defined **shift**ed keys) and deactivated (the current keymap switches back to `main`) on any key that is not defined in the `shift-select` keymap.
Thanks to this approach, it does not interfere with other plugins (for example, it works with https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions[zsh-autosuggestions] without any change).

Key bindings for moving the cursor _without_ selection (e.g. kbd:[Ctrl] + arrows, kbd:[Home] etc.) are out of scope of this plugin.

== Key Bindings

=== List of keys defined in the `emacs` and `shift-select` keymap:

* kbd:[Shift + Left Arrow] – select one character to the left
* kbd:[Shift + Right Arrow] – select one character to the right
* kbd:[Shift + Up Arrow] – select one line up
* kbd:[Shift + Down Arrow] – select one line down
* kbd:[Shift + Home] or kbd:[Shift + Ctrl + A] – select to the beginning of a line
* kbd:[Shift + End] or kbd:[Shift + Ctrl + E] – select to the end of a line
* kbd:[Shift + Ctrl + Left Arrow] ^<<macos>>^ – select to the beginning of a word
* kbd:[Shift + Ctrl + Right Arrow] ^<<macos>>^ – select to the end of a word
* kbd:[Shift + Ctrl + Home] ^<<macos>>^ – select to the beginning of an input buffer
* kbd:[Shift + Ctrl + End] ^<<macos>>^ – select to the end of an input buffer

[[macos, ]]
_^^ The last four actions use kbd:[Shift + Option] instead of kbd:[Shift + Ctrl] on macOS._


=== List of keys defined in the `shift-select` keymap only:

* kbd:[Delete] or kbd:[Backspace] – delete selected text

If you want to add custom key bindings to manipulate with active selection, define them in the `shift-select` keymap (`bindkey -M shift-select ...`).

TIP: You can use default kbd:[Alt + W] or kbd:[Ctrl + W] key bindings to copy (`copy-region-as-kill`) or cut (`backward-kill-word`) selected text to the “kill buffer”, and kbd:[Ctrl + Y] to paste (`yank`) the contents of the “kill buffer”.


== Known Issues

Some keys may not work in your terminal by default.
For example, https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/[kitty] uses kbd:[Shift + Ctrl] as the modifier for all kitty’s shortcuts (this can be changed with https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/conf/#opt-kitty.kitty_mod[kitty_mod]).
To find out if this is the case, run `cat` (without any arguments) in your terminal and press the key sequence in question. If nothing is printed, it means that your terminal or operating system has intercepted the key sequence.


== Installation

=== Using sheldon

If you use https://github.com/rossmacarthur/sheldon[sheldon] plugin manager, run the following command:

[source, sh, subs="+attributes"]
sheldon add {proj-name} --github {gh-name}


=== Using zgenom

If you use https://github.com/jandamm/zgenom[zgenom] (successor of https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen[zgen]) plugin manager, add `zgenom load "{gh-name}"` to your `.zshrc`.


=== Using Oh My Zsh

If you use https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh[Oh My Zsh] framework:

. Clone this repository into `$ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins` (by default `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins`):
+
[source, sh, subs="+attributes"]
git clone https://github.com/{gh-name}.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/{proj-name}

. Add the plugin to the list of plugins for Oh My Zsh to load (inside `$ZDOTDIR/.zshrc`, by default `~/.zshrc`):
+
[source, sh, subs="+attributes"]
plugins=(
    # other plugins...
    {proj-name}
)

. Start a new terminal session.


=== On Alpine Linux

If you use https://alpinelinux.org/[Alpine Linux] v3.16+ or Edge, you can install {proj-name} via `apk` and load it using the plugin loader provided in the default Zsh configuration on Alpine (see `/etc/zsh/zshrc`).

. Install {proj-name} package (as root).
[source, sh, subs="+attributes"]
apk add {proj-name}

. Symlink {proj-name} plugin to your Zsh plugins directory footnote:[Alternatively, you can add `ZSH_LOAD_SYSTEM_PLUGINS=yes` to your `.zshenv` to automatically load all Zsh plugins installed from Alpine packages.]:
[source, sh, subs="+attributes"]
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/zsh/plugins
ln -s /usr/share/zsh/plugins/{proj-name} ~/.local/share/zsh/plugins/


=== Manually (Git Clone)
:plugin-dir: ~/.local/share/zsh/plugins/{proj-name}

. Clone this repository somewhere on your machine. This guide will assume `{plugin-dir}`.
+
[source, sh, subs="+attributes"]
git clone https://github.com/{gh-name} {plugin-dir}

. Add the following to your `$ZDOTDIR/.zshrc` (by default `~/.zshrc`):
+
[source, sh, subs="+attributes"]
source {plugin-dir}/{proj-name}.plugin.zsh

. Start a new terminal session.
